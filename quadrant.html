            </div>
            <div class="container">
              <p>With the world taking a digital approach to all transactions, it is a need for people of today's society to have a safe method to send and receive money to friends, family, and merchants. Wouldn't it be nice to have an application that securely allows a user to add banks/cards to a digital platform, budget their money for personal or business use, and can pay anybody or entity? That is where Quadrant comes in, a responsive mobile digital payment platform that allows users to take control of their finances on the go.
              </p>
            <div>
              <p>My roles in this project were UX Designer, UI Designer, User Research, and User Testing. This project took approximately 5 months to complete.

            <h4>Understanding the Problem</h4>
          </div>
            <p>The first step was to get a better understanding of what problems users are having and what their needs are. Users need a way to shop, travel, or send money online without a card or have to use a physical bank or store to do so because of the growth in online shopping and transactions as well as problems that users face with security and efficiency.
            </p>
            <div>
              <p1>Problems include:</p1>
                <ul>
                  <li>Users have to insert information for multiple cards on apps</li>
                  <li>The lack of efficiency and ease of use making transactions</li>
                  <li>Information from the last purchase is not saved</li>
                  <li>A bank account or debit card is always needed</li>
                  <li>Information is not being properly secured with banks and cards</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="h4">
              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
            </div>
              <p>The next step was to understand how the competition was providing service to users so I conducted a competitive analysis for Google Pay and PayPal. My finding was that:</p>
              <div>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The major advantage that PayPal has is the fraud protection that is being used in its platform</li>
                    <li>The major advantage that Google Pay has is that it is supported by all 4 major banks in the U.S.</li>
                    <li>Paypal uses TV Commercials, social media channels, and outdoor advertisements to gain users</li>
                    <li>GooglePay advertises based on spending habits of users and partnerships with Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and Visa</li>
                  </ul>
              </div>
              <div id="h4">
                <h4>User Research</h4>
              </div>
                <p>The next step was to conduct research with users to understand how to build this platform. This gives me a chance to see what users are currently using to address the problem of shopping, sending, and receiving money digitally (if they are using any platform) and see the pros and cons they face.​​​​​​​
                </p>
                  <div>
                    <p1>After interviewing 3 users, these were the results of what was important to users:</p1>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Security</li>
                        <li>Ease of user</li>
                        <li>Accessibility on the go</li>
                        <li>Using a budgeting platform</li>
                        <li>Can link social media</li>
                        <li>Least amount of ads</li>

                  <h4>User Personas</h4>
                </div>
                  <p>The Next step was to create user personas based on the research done to this point. This allows me to put a face to the person that I am designing for and I decided to create two personas. After creating the personas it was time to create User Flows for them to complete tasks as they are using Quadrant.

                        <li>One was focused on sending a payment to friends & family</li>
                        <li>The other was focused on setting up a new budget</li>

                      <p>I decided to conduct an open card sorting test on Optimalsort so that I could possibly get new names for my categories. I gathered insights from 5 participants and they averaged at about 10 minutes per session.

                        <p>My research lead me to sketchpad and pen to work on some Low-Fidelitydesigns that would help clarify ideas for the mobile and desktop versions. The 3 features I decided to focus on were the Dashboard/Home screen, Payments, and Budgets.</p>

                          <p>After sketching out some mockups I decided to use Balsamiq to create a Low-fidelity prototype.</p>

                            <p>Finally, it was time to create a clickable version for users to test the prototype and make changes based on the results. I used Proto.io to create a clickable version for users to test and used Figma to make it interactive. Prototype for testing can be viewed here.
